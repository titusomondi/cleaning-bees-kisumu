                Over time these pieces get worn and faded due to regular wear and tear, but also due to spills and food that can cause stains.

            <p>Our technicians will use a concentrated solution to tackle the more stubborn and spotty areas. While we cannot guarantee removal of stains, we will try our best to remove or reduce the spots we come across.</p>
            <h4>Water Extraction (Steam cleaning)</h4>
            <p>Our technicians will use water, pressure and steam to penetrate deep within your fibers to extract dirt and harmful allergens. The most recommended method by carpet and upholstery manufacturers.</p>
